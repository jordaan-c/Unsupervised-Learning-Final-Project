#### Installation: 
This project is written in Python 3.8.10 and saved in the `.ipynb` format, for Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12. 
Libraries used include: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn and Sci-py. The distribution used to set this up was Anaconda 2.3.2 [Individual Edition].

The latest distribution can be found here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
